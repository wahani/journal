Why do I write this post?
-------------------------
Here I will discuss some interesting behavior of standard subsetting in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). Actually it is nothing special or completely unexpected, still I didn't see the mechanism right away.

Subsetting `data.frame`s
------------------------
### Basic subsetting
This is the data
```{r}
dat <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = rnorm(5))
```
```{r}
class(dat$x)
class(dat[["x"]])
class(dat[, "x"])
class(dat["x"])
```

### Interesting behavior
```{r}
dat[] <- lapply(dat, function(x) is.na(x))
```

### Why it works
